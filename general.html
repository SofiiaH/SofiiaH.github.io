    <h1>Before</h1>
	<p>Before the birth of my brother Anton, I was that annoying child who was pretty strict, direct and demanding both to myself and to others. I said and did what I wanted at the moment, not paying attention to feelings and needs of others. Despite I was only 8 y.o. and did not know much about life, all I thought about was from materialistic world. In general, I was self-centered.</p>

    <h1>What I observed that shaped me on the way to who I am now</h1>
	<p>Anton does everything exactly as others from his communication circle do. Sometimes it seems he assimilate those actions and poses subconsciously and immideately. The photo I took shows how my brother sat near our father and randomly but without not even looking on father’s pose sat exactly like him. I always notice that in his behavior. And such small things make me retake a look on what I do and what I show him as an example.</p>
	<p>The other thing, this boy is an absolute empath. He cannot speak well. But he listens. And does everything nonverbally to do what are we asking for and to satisfy our needs or heal pains we do not mention about to anyone. He is genuine, kind. It often seems children with the Down syndrome perceive this world on the more deep way we do. But thanks to my brother, I can see this world on the more tender level too. Thus, I can be more thoughtful, empathetic, and intuitive.</p>

    <h2>Main thing Anton taught me is how to be happy in this world and be satisfid with what I have.</h2>
	<p>His kindess helps me every day. His smile gives me energy and motivation. Activities and games we do together when we spend time together influence me as much as him, with the only differcence: he grows and aquires new skills but I grow mentally and in understanding world. Time I spent with him was a relaxation and kind of a practice of mindfulness.</p>

    <h1>Now</h1>
	<p>Now I am other-oriented type of person. I always worry about others’ state and wellness, pay attention to details, love simple things, and appreciate deep connections. Moreover, due to the responsibilities I have connected to my brother I don’t allow myself to act badly, unwisely or to do stupid things even when I not around him. Especially I cannot imagine myself picking up a habit like smoking or drinking, or hooligan.</p>
